Please note:
I got distracted with working on my work project that I had shared with the professor and she gave me permission to create instead of the task manager. But that project involved over 3000 graphs and was too complicated for me to have completed in this little time frame so i got really distracted and worked on this last minute. 

Here is some other versions i worked one but didnt complete:
<https://github.com/sameenawan/masters>
<https://github.com/sameenawan/foobooks>
<https://github.com/sameenawan/taskmanage>



I used some outside sources to help me create this project, i used some suggestions from tutorials from bizBiscuit.com management systems for functionality and user interface stuff.
